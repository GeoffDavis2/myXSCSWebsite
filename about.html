<p>After graduating from the University of Hawaii with a BS in Computer Science, I 
had one year before I had to report for duty at my first Air Force assignment.</p>

<p>What did I do with this time? I set up a Small Business called "Xcellent Software and Computer Systems".  
Initially, I worked as a contractor for a company which specialized in teaching office workers advanced 
use of Word Perfect, MS Word, MS Access, MS Excel, etc. I plugged my company "Xcellent Software" to the 
students and eventually grew a small group of regular clients.</p>

<p>I took a high profile contract with a Law firm which needed to transform a large database from one format to 
another.   I did routine work installing and maintaining software.  I did consultation work related to large 
IT purchases and solutions.  At 25, I was amazed I could charge $15 an hour (remember this was 1992).  
By the time I had to report for my first assignment in the Air Force, I was charging $19 an hour.</p>

<p>My first assignment was in Biloxi, Mississippi at the Air Force Basic Computer Officer Training school. 
I excelled there and after graduating, I was stationed at Los Angeles AFB. I was on my way to a 
promising career in Software Engineering for the Air Force.</p>

<p>Shortly after settling in for my first assignment, I was given the opportunity to become a pilot. 
I had to give it a try.  It was hard work but I graduated from Pilot Training and spent the last 20 years 
as a pilot in the Air Force.  While flying for the Air Force, I never gave up my love for Software Programming. 
I took every opportunity to remain current in IT and Software Engineering trends; for 3 years I worked as the IT Systems 
Administrator at a large High Tech organization.</p>

<p>I am retiring from the Air Force and will be available for hire on 15 August 2013. 
I have the following skills:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Software Engineering: Waterfall, Spiral, Rapid Application Development, Some limited experience with Agile</li>
  <li>Programming: Basic, ADA, Kyoto Lisp, Visual Basic, TurboPascal, C, C++, Java, PHP</li>
  <li>Web Design: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Flash Builder</li>
  <li>Relational DB Design and Programming (MS Acess, SQL, mySQL, Queries)</li>
  <li>Leadership, IT Management, Project Management</li>
  <li>Acquisitions and Contract Management</li>
  <li>MS Office Suite: MS Word, MS Access, MS Excel, MS Project, Visio</li>
</ul>
