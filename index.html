<h1>Xcellent Software and Computer Solutions</h1>
<h2>by Geoffrey V. Davis II</h2>

<hr/>

<p>After graduating from the University of Hawaii with a BS in Computer Science, Geoff 
had a year before he had to report for duty at his first Air Force assignment.</p>

<p>What did he do with this time? He set up a Small Business called "Xcellent Software and Computer Systems".  
Initially, he worked as a contractor for a company which specialized in teaching office workers advanced 
use of Word Perfect, MS Word, MS Access, MS Excel, etc. He plugged "Xcellent Software" to his students and eventually 
grew a small group of clients.</p>

<p>Geoff found that his expertise was in Database Management.  He took a high profile contract with a Law 
firm which needed to transform a large database from one format to another.   At 25, Geoff was amazed that 
he could charge $15 an hour (remember this was 1992).  By the time he had to report for his first assignment 
in the Air Force, Geoff was charging $19 an hour.</p>

<p>His first assignment was in Biloxi Mississippi at the Air Force Basic Computer Officer Training (BCOT) course.  
Geoff thrived at BCOT and after graduating, he was stationed at Los Angeles AFB. He was on his way to a 
promising career in Software Design for the Air Force.</p>

<p>Shortly after settling in for his first assignment, he was given the opportunity to become a pilot. 
He had to give it a try.  It was hard work but he graduated from Pilot Training and spent the last 20 years 
as a pilot in the Air Force.  While flying for the Air Force, he took every opportunity to remain current in 
IT and Software Engineering trends.</p>

<p>He is retiring from the Air Force and will be available for hire in August 2013. 
He has the following skills.</p>

<ul class="a">
  <li>Software Engineering: Waterfall, Spiral, Rapid Application Development, Some limited experience with Agile</li>
  <li>Programming: Basic, ADA, Kyoto Lisp, Visual Basic, TurboPascal, C, C++, Java, PHP</li>
