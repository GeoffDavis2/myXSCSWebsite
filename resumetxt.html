<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>- When I first
arrived at the Air Force Technical Application Center (AFTAC) in 2006, they
were undergoing a significant change to their mission and organizational
structure. Based on my IT background (college and initial Air Force Computer
Training); the Director asked me to learn the new mission, understand the IT
needs, and propose an organizational structure for IT Systems support. He liked
my proposal and made me the Chief of the Systems Division. During my 3 years as
the IT Systems Administrator, I was responsible for the IT needs of the large
high-tech organization tasked with nuclear treaty monitoring. We managed a
system that processed and stored data from multiple sensors on many satellites.
The data-stream was received 24/7 and 100% accurate / complete data was
critical. We completed many projects and dealt with many complex IT challenges.</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>- As the IT

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>Position: Student
(Graduate Project Team Lead)</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>- I led a team
which implemented the &quot;Waterfall&quot; software acquisition approach to
create an inventory system for a Grocery Store as a college graduation project.
We conducted interviews to learn how their business works and what they need.
We documented their requirements and obtained &quot;sign off&quot; for the
requirements. We completed preliminary project design to include Entity
Relationship Diagrams and Data Flow Diagrams. We created the program using our
design and held weekly configuration management meetings to ensure strict
change control. We drafted and implemented a test plan to ensure all
requirements were met and that the program was error free regardless of what
the user did. We created user documents and provided end user training to
approximately 20 end users. At the acceptance testing, we gave a final
presentation to the owner and obtained &quot;sign off&quot;. The program used
bar-code scanners for inventory management and at the checkout line. </span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>The user (Down to
Earth Grocery, in Honolulu, Hawaii) was ecstatic. The project was implemented
using Turbo Pascal and compiled into an executable program for stand-alone use.
We provided user support for 6 more months until we all graduated.</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>Position: Student
(Project Team Lead)</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>- I developed a
MS Access program / database for a fictional auto dealership. The program used
Visual Basic code and SQL queries to maintain a relational database with
employee data, auto inventory, and sales records. My teacher acted as the user.
The project was developed using the Rapid Application Development (RAD)
methodology. I interviewed the User and conducted Requirements Planning. I
constructed a Prototype and had the User interact with the Prototype. Based on
input from the user I made adjustments and additions. I alternated between the
Construction and the User Interaction phases until the User found the program
acceptable. In the Cut Over phase I did testing, drafted user documents, and
simulated User training. The simulated User (my teacher) signed off for
acceptance and I got an A in the class.</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>- Mastered JAVA
Enterprise Edition on Eclipse JEE. Developed a Java program which interacts
with a Web Services provider (using REST/SOAP/JSON interfaces). It reads a .txt
and finds SKU numbers in the file.  For each SKU found, it will send a request
to the Zappos Web Service (API). It processes the Web Service response to find
the Default Image jpg filename.  It then downloads the file and save it to
your computer.  This was a code challenge for Zappos.</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>- Setup my own
website to showcase my Software Engineering and Web Developer capabilities for
any prospective employer.  Check out [http://www.xcellent-software.com]. The
website has links to examples of code developed by me.  The website uses html
and css tags as well as php and javascript.  This website was created manually;
without using website tools such as DreamWeaver, BlueGriffon, etc.  Of
course I do know how to use these tools.</span></p>
